# SLC - Snips Led Control
Provides an easy way to control your leds on a Snips install. It is highly customizable and beginner friendly

**Do not simply clone the master and use it unless you know what you are doing!!** Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Psychokiller1888/snipsLedControl/wiki) for all the informations about how to install and use

It currently supports these hardwares:
- Respeaker 2
- Respeaker 4
- Respeaker Mic Array V2
- Respeaker core V2
- NeoPixels ring
- Matrix Voice
- Google AIY
- Any leds on gpios

I don't have the budget to buy every other devices just to implement them. If you are a manufacturer, **I appreciate hardware donations :-)**, they will be used wisely in my voice assistant projects.

But as they say, sometimes I'm thirsty so I still appreciate a beer every now and then, feel free to refresh me: https://paypal.me/Psychokiller1888
